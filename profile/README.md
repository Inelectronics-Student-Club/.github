## What is **ISC**?
The **INELECTRONICS** students' club (aka **ISC**) envisions building a bridge between university and industry. This is done by inviting the leading business companies in Algeria to the institute, construct a network with those companies, and set up partnerships to support our activities in order to realize our objectives. Such partnerships will, at the end, benefit to both students and our partners.
